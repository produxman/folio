# Project Overview

Motivated by the challenge of preventing misdirected emails and their security consequences, I played a pivotal role in the development of the early stage MVP for Preava while at VeraSafe. Preava's core functionality is centered on real-time behavior analysis and customizable rules to proactively reduce errors. Designed as a user-centric safeguard, Preava provides a critical solution for businesses navigating the complexities of data privacy and compliance.

# My Role

As Product Manager, I spearheaded the initial proof of concept phase for Preava Prevent. This involved extensive market research, wireframing, and design exploration to establish core functionality. I conducted in-depth user research and technical scoping to validate the concept.  My responsibilities spanned development collaboration, documentation, testing, and defining a launch strategy. This comprehensive approach ensured a user-centric focus and laid the foundation for Preava Prevent's successful development.

# Development

Leveraging Google App Script, and focused on intuitive UI/UX, the plugin seamlessly integrated with Gmail to provide real-time warnings of potential risks. Our initial MVP targeted Google Workspace exclusively, yet driven by market demand, we meticulously expanded compatibility to other popular email platforms. Extensive user testing and feedback cycles enabled continuous refinement, ensuring Preava Prevent consistently adapts to protect sensitive information across diverse email ecosystems.
